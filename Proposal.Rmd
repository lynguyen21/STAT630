## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
IMDb.top.1000.movies <- read.csv("~/Downloads/archive (2)/IMDb top 1000 movies.csv")
View(IMDb.top.1000.movies)
```

```{r}
mod <- lm(shopping_trends_updated$Age ~ shopping_trends_updated$Item.Purchased, data = shopping_trends_updated)
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(mod)
```
